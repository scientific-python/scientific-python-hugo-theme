## Hugo Layouts

- `_default/single.html` : Single page layout
- `_default/section.html` : Section layout (a section typically has `_index.md` and contains other pages)

Blog post layouts:

- `layouts/partials/posts/post.html`: Blog post layout
- `layouts/partials/posts/list.html`: Blog post listing layout
- `layouts/partials/posts/tag.html`: Tag page layout

## Shortcut list

The depths of the shortcut list on the left of each post can be
controlled by setting the `shortcutDepth` parameter in the post
preamble. It defaults to 2.

## Page information

Each page should contain a `summary` in the preamble, otherwise the
site description is provided as metadata.

## Custom stylesheets

Custom styles should be added to `/assets/css/my_css.css` (where
`my_css` can be any name, other than those already in the theme).

## Custom JavaScript

Custom JavaScript can be added as `/assets/js/my_js.js` (where `my_js`
can be any name).

## Code styling

To enable code styling, add the following to your config file:

```yaml
markup:
  highlight:
    noClasses: false
```

The default theme is [Witch Hazel](https://github.com/theacodes/witchhazel),
but with a blue background.
To use a different theme, [generate a new
stylesheet](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlight-shortcode)
using:

```
hugo gen chromastyles --style=monokai > /assets/css/code-highlight.css
```

You can replace `monokai` with any of the themes supported by
[Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma), as listed in their
[gallery](https://xyproto.github.io/splash/docs/).

Then, use fenced code blocks and remember to specify the language:

````md
```python
def foo(x):
    return x**2
```
````

## News

The first post from `/content/en/news` will be highlighted on the
front page. If you don't want that, remove the `/content/en/news`
folder.

By default, news items link to the `/news` category page (which lists
all news items). You can override that by setting `newsLink` in the
preamble of any news post.

### Single page news

If you prefer to list all your news items on one page, you may do so
in `/news.md`, instead of adding posts to `/news`. Set the
`newsHeader` parameter in the preamble of that document to populate
the banner on the front page.

## Team gallery

The `tools/team_query.py` file gets a list of team members from GitHub. To
use it, you will need to set the GH_TOKEN environment variable
to a personal access token.

Example usage:

```
python team_query.py --org scientific-python --team spec-steering-committee --title "Spec Steering Committee" > content/en/teams/spec-steering-committee.md
```

we generate a raw HTML gallery, and provide a
shortcode (include-html) for pulling it in anywhere on the site.

## Analytics

The theme supports analytics through Plausible, which can be self-hosted or paid-for at https://plausible.io/.
To enable Plausible analytics, add to your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
params:
  plausible:
    dataDomain: your-domain.org
    javaScript: https://your.plausible.io/javascript/path.js
```

By default, `javaScript` points to the server at
`https://views.scientific-python.org`. Contact the Scientific
Python team to have your analytics hosted there.

## Icons

You can add custom icons (for use in, e.g., the footer) by downloading Material-UI SVGs from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons) to the `/assets/icons` directory.

In the footer, the icons can then be used like the ones built-into the theme.
To use them elsewhere, e.g. in Hugo templates, we provide an `svg-icon` partial. For example, `/assets/icons/my-icon.svg` is displayed using:

```
{{ partial "svg-icon" "my-icon" }}
```

## Mermaid diagrams

[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams are rendered from code blocks:

````md
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
    A --> C(Round Rect)
    B --> D{Rhombus}
    C --> D
```
````

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
    A --> C(Round Rect)
    B --> D{Rhombus}
    C --> D
```

## Creating a blog

Pages that are placed under either `content/posts` or `content/blog`
will be formatted as blog posts.
