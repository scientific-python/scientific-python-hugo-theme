# The Scientific Python theme for Hugo

The **Scientific Python Hugo Theme** is a theme for the
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator built on the
[Fresh](https://github.com/StefMa/hugo-fresh) theme.

Please see the [theme
documentation](https://theme.scientific-python.org), especially the
[get started](https://theme.scientific-python.org/getstarted/) page.

## Theme development

When making PRs against this repository, a site preview of the theme
documentation will be rendered. From there, you can browse preview
builds of a few other community websites: `scipy`, `main`
(scientific-python.org), `blog`, and `learn`. E.g., if the preview link is

https://deploy-preview-301--scientific-python-hugo-theme.netlify.app/

browse to

https://deploy-preview-301--scientific-python-hugo-theme.netlify.app/blog

to see how the blog rendered.
